# Default configuration file documentation

This document explains the default [rc.lua](<../sample files/rc.lua.html#>) file provided by Awesome.

If LuaRocks is installed, make sure that packages installed through it are found (e.g. lgi). If LuaRocks is not installed, do nothing.
    
    
    pcall(require, "luarocks.loader")
    

The Awesome API is distributed across many libraries (also called modules).

Here are the modules that we import:

`gears`| Utilities such as color parsing and objects  
---|---  
[wibox](<../classes/wibox.html#>)| Awesome own generic widget framework  
`awful`| Everything related to window managment  
[naughty](<../libraries/naughty.html#>)| Notifications  
[menubar](<../libraries/menubar.html#>)| XDG (application) menu implementation  
[beautiful](<../libraries/beautiful.html#>)| Awesome theme module  
  
Standard awesome library
    
    
    local gears = require("gears")
    local awful = require("awful")
    require("awful.autofocus")
    

Widget and layout library
    
    
    local wibox = require("wibox")
    

Theme handling library
    
    
    local beautiful = require("beautiful")
    

Notification library
    
    
    local naughty = require("naughty")
    local menubar = require("menubar")
    local hotkeys_popup = require("awful.hotkeys_popup")
    

Enable hotkeys help widget for VIM and other apps when client with a matching name is opened:
    
    
    require("awful.hotkeys_popup.keys")
    

## Error handling

Awesome is a window managing framework. It allows its users great (ultimate?) flexibility. However, it also allows the user to write invalid code. Here’s a non-exhaustive list of possible errors:

  * Syntax: There is an `awesome -k` option available in the command line to check the configuration file. Awesome cannot start with an invalid [rc.lua](<../sample files/rc.lua.html#>)
  * Invalid APIs and type errors: Lua is a dynamic language. It doesn’t have much support for static/compile time checks. There is the `luacheck` utility to help find some categories of errors. Those errors will cause Awesome to “drop” the current call stack and start over. Note that if it cannot reach the end of the [rc.lua](<../sample files/rc.lua.html#>) without errors, it will fall back to the original file.
  * Invalid logic: It is possible to write fully valid code that will render Awesome unusable (like an infinite loop or blocking commands). In that case, the best way to debug this is either using `print()` or using `gdb`. For this, see the [Debugging tips Readme section](<../documentation/01-readme.md.html>)
  * Deprecated APIs: The Awesome API is not frozen for eternity. After a decade of development and recent changes to enforce consistency, it hasn’t changed much. This doesn’t mean it won’t change in the future. Whenever possible, changes won’t cause errors but will instead print a deprecation message in the Awesome logs. These logs are placed in various places depending on the distribution. By default, Awesome will print errors on `stderr` and `stdout`.


Check if awesome encountered an error during startup and fell back to another config (This code will only ever execute for the fallback config)
    
    
    if awesome.startup_errors then
        [naughty.notify](<../libraries/naughty.html#notify>)({ preset = naughty.config.presets.critical,
                         title = "Oops, there were errors during startup!",
                         text = awesome.startup_errors })
    end
    

Handle runtime errors after startup
    
    
    do
        local in_error = false
        awesome.connect_signal("debug::error", function (err)
            -- Make sure we don't go into an endless error loop
            if in_error then return end
            in_error = true
    
            [naughty.notify](<../libraries/naughty.html#notify>)({ preset = naughty.config.presets.critical,
                             title = "Oops, an error happened!",
                             text = tostring(err) })
            in_error = false
        end)
    end
    

## Variable definitions

To create custom themes, the easiest way is to copy the `default` theme folder from `/usr/share/awesome/themes/` into `~/.config/awesome` and modify it.

Awesome currently doesn’t behave well without a theme containing all the “basic” variables such as `bg_normal`. To get a list of all official variables, see the [appearance guide](<../documentation/06-appearance.md.html>). Themes define colours, icons, font and wallpapers.
    
    
    [beautiful.init](<../libraries/beautiful.html#init>)(gears.filesystem.get_themes_dir() .. "default/theme.lua")
    

  This is used later as the default terminal and editor to run.
    
    
    terminal = "xterm"
    editor = os.getenv("EDITOR") or "nano"
    editor_cmd = terminal .. " -e " .. editor
    

Default modkey. Usually, Mod4 is the key with a logo between Control and Alt. If you do not like this or do not have such a key, I suggest you to remap Mod4 to another key using xmodmap or other tools. However, you can use another modifier like Mod1, but it may interact with others.
    
    
    modkey = "Mod4"
    

  Table of layouts to cover with awful.layout.inc, order matters.
    
    
    [awful.layout.layouts](<../libraries/awful.layout.html#layouts>) = {
        awful.layout.suit.floating,
        awful.layout.suit.tile,
        awful.layout.suit.tile.left,
        awful.layout.suit.tile.bottom,
        awful.layout.suit.tile.top,
        awful.layout.suit.fair,
        awful.layout.suit.fair.horizontal,
        awful.layout.suit.spiral,
        awful.layout.suit.spiral.dwindle,
        awful.layout.suit.max,
        awful.layout.suit.max.fullscreen,
        awful.layout.suit.magnifier,
        awful.layout.suit.corner.nw,
        -- awful.layout.suit.corner.ne,
        -- awful.layout.suit.corner.sw,
        -- awful.layout.suit.corner.se,
    }
    

## Menu

  Create a launcher widget and a main menu
    
    
    myawesomemenu = {
       { "hotkeys", function() hotkeys_popup.show_help(nil, awful.screen.focused()) end },
       { "manual", terminal .. " -e man awesome" },
       { "edit config", editor_cmd .. " " .. awesome.conffile },
       { "restart", awesome.restart },
       { "quit", function() awesome.quit() end },
    }
    
    mymainmenu = [awful.menu](<../libraries/awful.menu.html#>)({ items = { { "awesome", myawesomemenu, beautiful.awesome_icon },
                                        { "open terminal", terminal }
                                      }
                            })
    
    mylauncher = [awful.widget.launcher](<../classes/awful.widget.launcher.html#>)({ image = beautiful.awesome_icon,
                                         menu = mymainmenu })
    

Menubar configuration
    
    
    [menubar.utils.terminal](<../libraries/menubar.utils.html#terminal>) = terminal -- Set the terminal for applications that require it
    

Keyboard map indicator and switcher
    
    
    mykeyboardlayout = [awful.widget.keyboardlayout](<../classes/awful.widget.keyboardlayout.html#>)()
    

## Wibar

Create a textclock widget
    
    
    mytextclock = [wibox.widget.textclock](<../classes/wibox.widget.textclock.html#>)()
    

Create a wibox for each screen and add it  
    
    
    local taglist_buttons = [gears.table.join](<../libraries/gears.table.html#join>)(
                        [awful.button](<../classes/awful.button.html#>)({ }, 1, function(t) t:view_only() end),
                        [awful.button](<../classes/awful.button.html#>)({ modkey }, 1, function(t)
                                                  if client.focus then

                                                  end
                                              end),
                        [awful.button](<../classes/awful.button.html#>)({ }, 3, awful.tag.viewtoggle),

                                                  end

## Mouse bindings

 
    
    
    root.buttons([gears.table.join](<../libraries/gears.table.html#join>)(
        [awful.button](<../classes/awful.button.html#>)({ }, 3, function () mymainmenu:toggle() end),
        [awful.button](<../classes/awful.button.html#>)({ }, 4, awful.tag.viewnext),
        [awful.button](<../classes/awful.button.html#>)({ }, 5, awful.tag.viewprev)
    ))
    

## Key bindings

This section stores the global keybindings. A global keybinding is a shortcut that will be executed when the key is pressed. It is different from [client keybindings](<#client_keybindings>). A client keybinding only works when a client is focused while a global one works all the time.

Each keybinding is stored in an [awful.key](<../libraries/awful.key.html#>) object. When creating such an object, you need to provide a list of modifiers, a key or keycode, a callback function and extra metadata used for the [awful.hotkeys_popup](<../libraries/awful.hotkeys_popup.html#>) widget.

Common modifiers are:

Name | Description  
---|---  
Mod4| Also called Super, Windows and Command ⌘  
Mod1| Usually called Alt on PCs and Option on Macs  
Shift| Both left and right shift keys  
Control| Also called CTRL on some keyboards  
  
Note that both `Mod2` and `Lock` are ignored by default. If you wish to use them, add `awful.key.ignore_modifiers = {}` to your [rc.lua](<../sample files/rc.lua.html#>). `Mod3`, `Mod5` are usually not bound in most keyboard layouts. There is an X11 utility called `xmodmap` to bind them. See [the ARCH Linux Wiki](<https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/xmodmap>) for more information.

The key or keycode is usually the same as the keyboard key, for example:

  * “a”
  * “Return”
  * “Shift_R”


Each key also has a code. This code depends on the exact keyboard layout. It can be obtained by reading the terminal output of the `xev` command. A keycode based keybinding will look like `#123` where 123 is the keycode.

The callback has to be a function. Note that a function isn’t the same as a function call. If you use, for example, `awful.tag.viewtoggle()` as the callback, you store the **result** of the function. If you wish to use that function as a callback, just use `awful.tag.viewtoggle`. The same applies to methods. If you have to add parameters to the callback, wrap them in another function. For the toggle example, this would be `function() awful.tag.viewtoggle(mouse.screen.tags[1]) end`.

Note that global keybinding callbacks have no argument. If you wish to act on the current [client](<../classes/client.html#>), use the [client keybindings](<#client_keybindings>) table.

A client keybinding is a shortcut that will get the currently focused client as its first callback argument. For example, to toggle a property, the callback will look like `function© c.sticky = not c.sticky end`. For more information about the keybinding syntax, see the [global keybindings](<#global_keybindings>) section.
